UNSUPPORTED,Unsupported,"[""Free Standing"",""No Brace"",""In Space""]",No external bracing. The body must provide all stability internally. Highest core/lower back demand.,{},0,,TRUE,admin
SINGLE_LIMB_BRACED,Single-Limb Braced,"[""3-Point Stance"",""One Hand Braced"",""One-Arm Support""]",One limb (hand or foot) is used for balance. Reduces spinal load but still requires rotational core stability.,{},1,,TRUE,admin
DOUBLE_LIMB_BRACED,Double-Limb Braced,"[""4-Point Stance"",""Hand and Knee Braced"",""Two-Point Support""]","Two limbs are used for bracing (e.g., knee and hand on a bench). Provides high stability and eliminates most rotational demand.",{},2,,TRUE,admin
TORSO_BRACED,Torso Braced,"[""Chest Supported"",""Back Supported"",""Lying on Bench""]",The torso is fully supported by a pad or bench. Maximum isolation of the target muscles; core and lower back are completely offloaded.,{},3,,TRUE,admin
